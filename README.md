## **A growth mindset**

A growth mindset is very important to adopt when working in a the world of development, it is about always learning and expanding your mind. To quote *Steve Haffenden*;

> It can open pathways to more creativity and possibility, and enable the setting of higher goals and more achievement.

A Growth mindset is about;

- ~~Avoiding~~ Embracing Challenges
- ~~Losing focus~~ Persisting with obstacles
- Viewing effort as ~~fruitless~~ no pain, no gain
- ~~Ignoring~~ Embracing Criticism
- Seeing the success of others ~~as a threat~~ inspring

### Text Editors

There are many options for text editors, every OS will come with their own however there are others available that offer a lot of additional features that prove very helpful to those that code.

These features are things such as;

- Code completion - This will often complete common pieces of code such as tags, attributes and more as well as adding closing tags and closing brackets automatically.
- Syntax Highlighting - This is a big one for me, the text editor can recognise your file type and will highlight different syntax in different colours to show what is a tag, what's an attribute and whats a function amoung many other things.
- Themes - A variety of themes is often available as well. This allows you to customise the experience to your liking. A lot of people find dark themes easier on the eyes so it's important to have choice.
- Extensions - These are basically plug-ins that will help you power up your text editor and add extra features. Often community made and often with a rating system as well.

At the end of the day the best thing to do is experiment with a few different text editors and go with the one best suited to you and your workstyle.

### The Command Line

The command line is a powerful tool in any coders arsenal. The information we have been given covers the command line in bash however I myself use zsh instead. I find this to be much better and it allows me access to other features I desire.

The command line will allow you to do many things such as `cd` to navigate, `ls` to see the directories contents, `mkdir` to create a new directory, `touch` to create a new file and `echo` to echo back a string (amoung other more advanced things).

Of course all of these can be done via the GUI but doing so from the CLI can be handy as well as we will use the CLI a lot to initialise GIT and other services.

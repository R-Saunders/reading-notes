### Expressions and Operators

#### Assignment operators

An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal `=` which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, `x = f()` is an assignment expression that assigns the value of `f()` to `x`.

MDN offers the following table for assignment operators.

|Name|Shorthand Operator|Meaning|

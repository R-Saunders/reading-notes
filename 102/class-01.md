## Markdown

Markdown is one of the most common, lightweight markup laguages that is used to add formatting elements to plain text documents. It was created in 2004 by John Gruber and has become very popular since.

Markdown differs to a word processor or a WYSIWYG editor, instead of clicking buttons to format text you use Markdown syntex to indicate when and how words should look different.

- For example, a header is prefixed with either one or more hash (#) symbols. The number of # symbols will denote whether it is a Heading one down to a Heading six.

- Anything in **bold** will be surrounded by double asterisks.

- *Italics* are surrounded by a single asterisk.

- A triple asterisk will give you ***bold and italic*** together.

- > Quotes start with a greater than symbol.

There's much more you can do to.

## Github Pages

Github pages is a way to publish your webpages and work with ease.

You can publish your sites in a repo using it and take things further with Jekyll too.

It's a great way to take away the deployment side of things and focus purely on the code.
